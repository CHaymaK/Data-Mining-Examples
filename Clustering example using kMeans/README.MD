- FRESH: annual spending on fresh products
- MILK: annual spending on milk products
- GROCERY: annual spending on grocery products
- FROZEN: annual spending on frozen products
- DETERGENTS_PAPER: annual spending on detergents and paper products

We will use this dataset to extract clustering patterns, i.e. determine whether these customers can be divided into a small number of groups.
